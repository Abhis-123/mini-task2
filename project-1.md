## Project 1:
 #### Problem Statement:
 Own GPS Transmitter with the HC-12 Transceiver .Means Creation of a tracking device in which we don't need the cellular network  .

 #### Initial ideation:-
 For this project we need two transrecievers  to transmit data between two parts of the project ,a gps module ,battery and a Aurdino Uno 3 .GPS coordinates can be transmitted to remote locations simply with a GPS receiver. Remotely transmitted coordinates need to be received by a second transceiver, then processed with a computer or microcontroller (Aurdino Uno 3).
 
 #### Pipeline:
Steps: Powersupply=>Connect GPS Reciever => Refining Data=>Transmit Data(refined)=>Recieve Data=>Use Data On live maps.

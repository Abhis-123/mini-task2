## Project 1:
 #### Problem Statement:
 Own GPS Transmitter with the HC-12 Transceiver .Means Creation of a tracking device in which we don't need the cellular network  .

 #### Initial ideation:-
 For this project we need two transrecievers  to transmit data between two parts of the project ,a gps module ,battery and a Aurdino Uno 3 .GPS coordinates can be transmitted to remote locations simply with a GPS receiver. Remotely transmitted coordinates need to be received by a second transceiver, then processed with a computer or microcontroller (Aurdino Uno 3).
 
 #### Pipeline:
Steps: Powersupply=>Connect GPS Reciever => Refining Data=>Transmit Data(refined)=>Recieve Data=>Use Data On live maps.
 
Step| Solutions available | Advantages | Disadvantages
--------|---------------------|------------|--------------
 1.Power Supply                  |Battery                             | It is the only possible solution for continuous supply  
 2.GPS reciever                   |1.SparkFun Electronics GPS-14030<br/>2.Ublox NEO-M8N GPS Module|1.it is a cheap product with less number of facilities<br/>2.It is 4 times in price but it more data then GPS it can operate from -45 degree celsious to 105 degree  clesious 
3.Refining Data                   |1.Aurdino Uno 3 <br> 2              | It is a easily avilable product
